// Game Option: Tamagotchi

//pseudo-coding:

// create an object with three properties: boredom, hunger, and sleepiness, each will have an initial value of zero 

//ex: let object = boredom = 0 hunger = 0 sleepiness - 0

//create a variable named timer that will store the timer in the game 

//create a variable called gameOver to present that the player has lost the game 

// both steps do not need to hold values 

//ex: let timer 
//let gameOver 

// cache elements that need to be referenced in the game 

// make 3 constants each to store spans and button elements

//create gameMessageEL and make it store game status 

//create a reset button 

//initialize the game 
//function init and call it init()

//set gameOver to false inside this function 

//make timer = setInterval() pass this function named runGame()

//create function named runGame 

//function runGame says "the game is running!"

//make function render()
//make function updateStates() use Math.random()

//invoke updateStates() and render() inside runGame()

//in render each cach stat element should be assigned to their corespondsing property in state using text content 

//boredomStatEl = state.boredom 
//hungerStatEl = state.hunger 
//sleepinessStatEl = state.sleepiness 

// create a function called checkGameOver 

//create a handleClick() function to handle each instance where each button is clicked 

//create a reset functionality to restart the game
